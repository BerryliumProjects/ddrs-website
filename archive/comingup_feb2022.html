<p>This meeting will be part Social but it is also hoped to show a recording of a presentation given to Sutton club about the ITNERP calculations we are supposed to have done to conform with our licences. While some details of the calculator may have updated since the recording the basic info remains useful. </p>

<p> This meeting will be over Zoom, rather than in person.  Joining details have been sent via email to members and registered friends of the club. We intend to resume in-person meetings in March, subject to government recommendations.</p>

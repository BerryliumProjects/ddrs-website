<p>Ken will refer to some of the radio and related equipment which was in use during World War II and afterwards including when the Dorking and District Radio Society was formed in 1947. By this time radios had evolved from their early twentieth century origins as simple devices in bulky boxes to complex pieces of equipment quite often housed in beautiful wooden cabinets. Although bulky compared to modern equipment, these devices incorporated many of the features and technical principles still in use today.</p> 

<p>During World War II, radio equipment was difficult to acquire and spares were in short supply. In contrast, following the end of the War, a large amount of surplus radio equipment became available, affording the opportunity for many an amateur enthusiast to pursue their interests. This period remained an era of valve (vacuum tube) technology, however. Although demonstrated as a working device in 1947 by researchers at Bell Laboratories, the transistor did not appear in commercially available radios until 1954.</p> 

<p>To illustrate his talk, with Jon&apos;s assistance, Ken will show examples of equipment from the era. This will include HRO and 11-55 receivers, various electronic components, one or two crystal sets and some valves. In addition, it is hoped to be able to demonstrate Hertz&apos;s Experiment which was used to confirm the existence of electromagnetic waves as predicted by Maxwell.</p>

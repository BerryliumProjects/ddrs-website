<p>It will soon be a year since the first death known to be linked to Covid-19, in China. In this country, the first lockdown was announced on 23rd March, and since then DDRS has been supporting people via its daily nets on 144.775MHz and Sunday nets on 3.772MHz. Both members and non-members have been welcome to join in.</p>

<p>On Saturday 7th November, the Club will be holding its <b>two-hundredth</b> such net, and particularly welcomes all local radio amateurs between 10am and 11am on 144.775MHz FM. </p>

<p>At a convenient pause when passing between participants, please just mention your callsign, you will then be incorporated into the &apos;rota&apos; by the net controller, who is usually Jon G3GNA.</p>

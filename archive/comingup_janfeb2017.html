<h1>Practical Evenings on 24th January and 28th February 2017</h1>

<p>The January and February 2017 meetings will consist of two practical evenings with the following activities:</p>

<h3> The construction of a 7 MHz (40 m) mini transceiver </h3>

<p>The mini transceiver, which will operate at up to 300 mW, costs around &pound;4 for the components and the construction details. This device has been constructed with ease by members of another club. A small number of devices will be made available by the club for construction.</p>

<p>If anyone wishes to make use of this construction activity to qualify as the practical construction component for the Intermediate Examination, please note that the construction work must be your own. Please contact John Kelly by Tuesday 17th January if you wish to take advantage of this opportunity.</p>

<h3> A demonstration of the new Icom IC-7300 </h3>

<p>The Icom IC-7300 is a software defined radio transceiver but one which does not require a separate pc to operate, that is, it is a standalone direct sampling device with knobs, a built in spectrum / waterfall display and a touch screen. The IC-7300 employs an RF direct sampling system. RF signals are directly converted to digital data and processed in the FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array), making it possible to simplify the circuit construction.</p>

<h3> A Morse Code teaching class </h3>

<p>This will be offered at the participants&apos; required level, that is, from beginners up to 20 words per minute.</p>

<p>This will be a meeting via Zoom, on the subject of maritime wireless telegraphy from the Kingstown Regatta in 1898 to the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 and beyond.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 and the subsequent enquiry, the then-Postmaster General Herbert Samuel publicly declared: &quot;Those who have been saved, have been saved through one man, Mr. Marconi … and his marvellous invention.&quot;  But what were the origins of this &quot;marvellous&quot; and life-saving invention and what impact did it have on maritime safety?  From young Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi’s world&apos;s first of live event reporting by wireless at the Kingstown (now Dun Laoghaire) Yachting Regatta in July 1898 through to Marconi&apos;s experiments at Crookhaven between 1901 and 1914 and hence to the vital, life-saving use of Marconi wireless telegraphy on board the Titanic in 1912, this illustrated talk will uncover the practical and commercial application of wireless telegraphy for the maritime world and its potential impact upon maritime safety in the twentieth century.</p> 

<p>Dr Bruton is Curator of Technology and Engineering at the Science Museum, London specialising in communications.  She recently curated the Top Secret: From Ciphers to Cyber Security exhibition which explored over a century of secret communications, codes and ciphers from 1919 to cyber security today, through the lens of the centenary of GCHQ.</p>  

<p>This will be a virtual club event, held using the &quot;Zoom&quot; application. Members should receive an email, with the details of when and how to join the meeting. </p>

<p>The July club meeting has traditionally been an expedition to the Devil&apos;s Dyke on the South Downs to operate from an elevated beautiful location, followed by a meal/refreshments at the adjoining restaurant. However because of the restrictions due to the coronavirus outbreak this year, the club has decided that something similar but closer to the area would be more appropriate.</p>

<p>We have found a suitable location on Ranmore, a couple of miles Northwest of Dorking. Like the Devil&apos;s Dyke, this is a National Trust location with a car park and spectacular views - see <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/National+Trust's+Denbies+Hillside/@51.2408547,-0.3781684,14z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4875dd87e3c0ba35:0xaa605bf0b1597e87!8m2!3d51.241243!4d-0.366092" target="_blank">map</a> for address and directions. The gridsquare locator is <b>IO91TF</b>.</p>

<p> There are various possibilities for setting up a portable station depending on particular requirements:

<ul>
    <li>A <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eXbF5rQEXTNwHdrM9" target="_blank">grass overflow car park</a>, where proximity to a vehicle for power or antenna mounting is needed;</li>
    <li>A picnic area with three tables and benches, next to a meadow area where antennas could be set up</li>
    <li>Plenty of grassland, with some isolated benches</li>
</ul>

<p>Access to the main field (with the best views) is through a gate next to the ticket machine and display board. It is light until around 8:45pm so we suggest you come from 7pm onwards to set up equipment. In consideration of others using the location for recreation, please bring headphones or avoid turning the the speaker volume up too much.</p>

<p>If possible we would encourage those with equipment to please welcome others to join them and gain some operating experience in a supportive environment.</p>

<p class="redhighlight">Please note there are no toilet facilities or mains power at the site.</p>

<p>This is an open meeting - members of other clubs are welcome to join us. You don&apos;t need to confirm if you intend to come - a further email will be sent if the event needs to be cancelled due to the weather.</p>

<p>HF conditions in March were fairly average for this stage in the sun spot cycle, but a number of big and popular contests proved that DX is still relatively easy - perhaps because more stations transmit in these.  It is too easy at other times - and fatal - to tune over an HF band, hear nothing, and then switch off.   We should all, at least, give two or three CQ calls before doing so.</p>
<p>Whilst I do not take contests seriously I like to have a few QSOs and in the ARRL SSB contest I enjoyed working a few W&apos;s on 80 metres (split frequency), and on 40 metres. On 20 metres, with only 5 watts, I exchanged reports with Canada and Stateside.  15 metres was open too, during daylight hours.</p>
<p>I could not spend much time on the air during the 24 hours of the BERU Contest but worked ZB2, 9H1, C4, and 9G on CW quickly on the Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Then, later in the month, before I left for a /P holiday in Cyprus, I worked an all time new one: ZX5J in the South Shetlands. So not a bad month.</p> 
<p>And Keith reports that he worked W7 on SSB with his 50 watts and vertical antenna.</p>
<p>In Cyprus H2017PFO is on air every Tuesday morning on 20 and 15 metres before 0900Z. Do give them a call. They have two new female licencees in their club.</p>

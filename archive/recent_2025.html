 <h3>Lightning Talks</h3>
<p><i>22 April 2025</i></p>

<p>The evening consisted of a series of short presentations by members of the club. Jon Weller G0GNA demonstrated his collection of morse keys; David Browning M0LMF gave a presentation about improving portable VHF operation; Colin Berry M0GXV talked about organ pipes and their analogy with resonant antennas; and David Smith M0SXD exhibited his work as an artist. Each part was informal with questions and discussion, and provided an opportunity to learn more about some club members outside the context of amateur radio.</p>

 <h3>Antennas and Modelling</h3>
<p><i>27th May 2025</i></p>

<p>This was planned as an outside operating event but due to inclement weather, the club went online to watch and discuss an episode of the RSGB's "Tonight at 8" video presentation: Basic modelling and antennas for portable HF by Tim Hier, G5TM. The operating event will now be in June when we hope the weather will be more suitable.</p>

 <h3>CHOTA Special Event Station</h3>
<p><i>13th September 2025</i></p>

<p>Club members set up and operated a temporary station at Christ Church, Epsom Common, in support of the national "Churches and Chapels on the Air" annual event. The special callsign GB4CEC was arranged for the day. The HF antenna was a dipole strung between the top of the church tower and a tree. After joining the club's Saturday morning 2m net, we made many SSB contacts with other CHOTA event stations, and also some CW contacts. </p>

 <h3>Station Focus</h3>
<p><i>25th September 2025</i></p>

<p>Mike 2E0ESU gave a presentation focussing on his own radio station, covering rigs, antennas and CW assistance technology. We discussed the relative merits of transceiver human interface design, contrasting the minimal front panel approach with most functions in menus, versus the "button for everything" design, noting that even that may have much more in menus to be discovered. The role of morse readers and generators in aiding training and operating was also explored.</p>

 <h3>Radio on the Titanic</h3>
<p><i>23rd October 2025</i></p>

<p>Colin M0GXV gave an illustrated presentation on the radio station aboard the RMS Titanic, which was ultimately successful in arranging a rescue, saving many lives. The "Marconi T" antenna, main and backup spark transmitters, and two generations of receiver (using the mature Magnetic Detector and new diode valve) were explained. Colin had recently visited the Chelmsford Museum which has a reproduction of a Marconi radio room, and showed original photos of the exhibits there. An NEC model of the Titanic antenna was also demonstrated, leading to some insights into its characteristics and how the receiver audio might have sounded.</p>

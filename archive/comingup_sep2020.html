<p>Jim Lee started out with an interest in amateur radio and got his licence at the age of 17 in 1971. He went on to work for the BBC, ultimately running Radio 4 output as a continuity announcer and news reader.  Jim will talk about the varied roles he has performed along the way, on Radios 2, 3 and the World Service, commercial radio, BBC local radio, and regional television.</p>

<p>Alongside all of this, Jim is still active in amateur radio. He is chairman of the London BBC Radio Group, which was hurriedly formed to stop <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/G8BBC" target="_blank">G8BBC</a> from being revoked. During lockdown, he has had several occasions to work at New Broadcasting House in London, and has been active on HF and 2m from there when time has allowed.</p> 

<p>This will be a virtual club event, held using the &quot;Zoom&quot; application. Members should receive an email shortly beforehand, with the details of when and how to join the meeting. The length of a meeting session is limited using this medium - when it stops (after around 40 minutes), please re-join again to continue. </p>

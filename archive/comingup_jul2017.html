<p>This annual expedition to the Devil's Dyke on the South Downs is being co-ordinated by Jon Weller, G0GNA. Please liaise with him regarding arrangements if you would like to take part. The aim will be to establish and run a 2m SSB/FM station, commencing at 6pm and operating until about 9pm using G7DOR/P. All are encouraged to participate or to operate other stations on other frequencies. </p> 

<p>Please come to Devils Dyke to participate in whatever way you wish. There is a pub with good food for sustenance. If you are unable to come, you are of course welcome to call the club station.</p>

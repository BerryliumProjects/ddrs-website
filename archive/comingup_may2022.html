<p> Before he retired, Mike was a specialist designer of military naval electronic systems for some 50 year and he is going to give an illustrated talk about some of the things that he did, which should be of great interest to the radio amateurs.  He was a member of the design team for the two new RN aircraft carriers, so come along, should be interesting!</p>

<p>Nick&apos;s talk will cover where amateur radio came from, current changes and where it may be going to. This covers the period from his licensing as a schoolboy in the 1960s through to much DXing from Africa in the past decade and, of course his experiences as RSGB President over the past two years.</p> 

<p>Nick is also interested in where amateur radio clubs are heading and he will touch on this during his talk. He himself is a member of several clubs:

<ul><li> FOC (First Class CW Operators&apos; Club)</li>
<li>CDXC (Chiltern DX Club, the UK&apos;s premier DX Foundation)</li>
<li>RSARS (Royal Signals Amateur Radio Society)</li>
<li>the Radio Society of Kenya.</li></ul>

This affords a hint of the breadth of his interests. In addition to the call sign <b>G3RWF</b>, Nick also currently holds the call signs <b>GB4RS</b>, <b>5Z4LS</b> (Kenya, since 1968) and <b>5X1NH</b> (Uganda). More information is available on <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/G3RWF" target="_blank">QRZ.COM</a>.</p>

<p><i>This is an important meeting and we are honoured to welcome the President to Dorking. We look for a well-attended meeting by DDRS members and friends from other clubs. The president&apos;s views and concerns are of interest to us all.</i></p>

<p> For the October meeting, we have decided to use this opportunity to invite members and visitors to offer a few of their own hints or to ask questions about antennas covering aspects such as: </p>

<p><ol> 
<li> The types of antenna in use, for example, home-made or purchased and the frequency bands covered;</li>

<li> The method of support, for example, free standing mast or attached to the house;</li>

<li>Other important considerations, such as height, earthing, lightning and matching to the required impedance;</li>

<li> Experiences using antennas, in particular, successes and failures.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>The antenna is one of the fundamental components of any radio system and can be a limiting factor in overall performance; this is an opportunity to share knowledge and discover more about this fascinating device which converts an RF signal to an electromagnetic wave and vice versa.</p>

<p>We will aim to organise the projector and screen; however, if anyone wishes to use this will you please bring your own PC to connect to it. We have cables for VGA and HDMI. </p>

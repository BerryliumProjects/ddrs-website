<p>For me the 40m band sits comfortably between the local noise which swamps 80m, and the enthusiastic DX focus of 20m. However it normally needs a large outdoor space for an antenna and routing for feeders back to the station.  A small loop antenna can avoid these constraints and even work indoors, albeit with some reduction in efficiency and more critical tuning.</p>

<p>The presentation will reflect a journey of discovery over several years to understand what is really going on in such an antenna and to evolve a working experiment without expensive components. The reasons why you might (and might not) want to embark on such a journey, the issues you may face and the mathematical theory will be covered, along with some techniques for tuning the loop and modelling its design.</p>

<p>Colin became interested in radio and electronics at a young age, and discovered amateur radio by picking up a topband morse practice station on a shortwave set. He passed the RAE at university, but difficulties learning to read CW were a barrier to gaining an HF licence and the hobby lapsed. That was until his son discovered amateur radio for himself and they both became licensed. Colin is still practising CW to follow QSLs on 40m, and the loop antenna has been ideal for this and for satisfying his appetite for experimentation.</p>

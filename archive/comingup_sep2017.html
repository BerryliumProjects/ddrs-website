<p> Mick Senior (Manager, RSGB Region 10) will be presenting a talk on the ISS Project with Schools, which enabled pupils in selected schools to talk directly with Tim Peake on board the International Space Station (ISS) whilst the ISS was over the UK, using an amateur radio link established at the schools with the support of amateur radio enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Mick&apos;s talk on the ISS Project will cover the three scheduled ISS contacts with schools in the RSGB Region 10 which were selected as part of the Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) Scheme to contact Tim Peake on the Space Station. The schools were: St Richards Catholic College (Bexhill-on-Sea), the Royal Masonic School for Girls (Rickmansworth) and Wellesley House School (Broadstairs). The scheme was a collaboration between the UK Space Agency, the Radio Society of Great Britain (RSGB) and the European Space Agency (ESA). The schools were provided with the necessary radio equipment including low earth orbit satellite tracking antennas and radios, in order to establish a fully functional, direct radio link with the ISS from the schools&apos; own premises. In the ten-minute windows, whilst the ISS was over the UK, amateur radio contact could be established with Tim, and students were able to ask him questions about his life and work on board the ISS. Mick&apos;s talk will also some provide interesting facts about the ISS.</p>

<p>Mick was first licensed as G8EFO in 1970. Having learned the basics of CW he subsequently passed the required part of the exam to become G4EFO in 1974. He has been involved with the Sussex Repeater Group since its conception and built the original cavity duplexer for GB3SR at Brighton, a story in itself. Mick now looks after GB3WS, GB3NX and GB3HO. He was also a member of the original Repeater Management Group, a committee of the RSGB. In 2014, Mick became regional manager for the RSGB Region 10 (South East England). The area which he covers extends from Dover in the East to Trowbridge in the West and anywhere South of the M4 corridor within this extent.</p>

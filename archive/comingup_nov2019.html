<p>We have been advised by the Dorking Friends Meeting House management that due to the forthcoming election we are unable to use our usual room. We have therefore made alternative arrangements and have transferred our booking to the Dorking Christian Centre, Church Lane, Dorking RH4 1DW.  The building is located in the grounds of St. Martin&apos;s Church which is a very prominent church in the middle of Dorking almost opposite the White Horse Hotel (where we held our Christmas dinner a few years ago). </p>

<p> There is no allocated parking at the Christian Centre but there is a free (evenings only) large car park very close by known as St. Martins car park and accessed through Mill Lane. Access to the Christian Centre is along the footpaths within the church grounds and also from the High Street. </p>

<p> The room we have booked is on the first floor at the Christian Centre. The programme remains unchanged: 

<ul>
   <li> 7:45pm AGM </li>
   <li> followed by video on 3D printing </li>
   <li> close by 10pm. </li>
</ul> </p>

<p> Opportunities to serve on the committee as a office holder or ordinary member will be available, as some committee members will not be standing for re-election. If you feel able to help in this way please let the club secretary know. </p>

<p> Bookings for the Christmas dinner should also be made by the AGM, so we can send the meal choices to the restaurant in good time. </p>

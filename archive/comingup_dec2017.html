Dene Street is a North-bound one way street, and you cannot turn off the High Street into it. The easiest approach by car is to turn off the bypass down Chart Lane, which becomes Dene Street; the restaurant is then on the left opposite some public parking spaces. There are also some spaces in front of the restaurant itself.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Alternatively, you can use one of the other car parks in Dorking and walk up Dene Street a hundred yards or so from the High Street. Please see this

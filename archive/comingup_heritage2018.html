<p> Polesden Lacey House and Grounds (Great Bookham, near Dorking, Surrey, RH5 6BD) is hosting a <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/events/8635f340-a983-4926-b160-4ccd1916299d/pages/details" target="_blank">Heritage Radio Exhibition and Station</a> on Saturday 8 September.  The Club will be operating from there from about 10am to 4:30pm on a number of bands including 2m.</p>

<p> This year, the national Heritage Open Days event extends over two weekends.  To cover them both, Polesden Lacey will also be hosting their own heritage events on Saturday 15 September, with free admission to the house and grounds. </p>

<p>Setting up will commence at 8:30am and anyone who is able to attend and offer assistance and support would be most welcome, particularly during the setting up period. More details can be obtained from Roger Humphreys. This <a href="location_polesdenlacey.html">annual heritage event</a> attracts many interested visitors and is an excellent showcase for our hobby.</p>

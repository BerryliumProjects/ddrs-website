<p> HF conditions continued in their summer doldrums in August, and the SFI number (Solar Flux Index) sank and hovered around 68 for much of the time. Coincidentally I was reading an Antenna book one night before going to bed and saw that the accepted range for the index is 66 to 300, so that places where we are close to the worst we are likely to experience. </p>

<p>On 80 metres even the DDRS Sunday net experienced very poor inter-G propagation on 19th and Tom G4DFA even lost Jon G0GNA completely at one stage.</p>

<p>Yet as I write on 5th September the SFI number is 186! But the magnetic fields are strong too and HF conditions are poor in consequence with radio blackouts. The sun is very disturbed.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time re-cabling my 17/12 metre beam in August. The birds or squirrels had eaten through the thinner coax around the rotator and this needed replacing. Fortunately I decided to check the loss in the main feeder (R213) and was disturbed to see that over a length of 140 feet or so it was 1.8 dB. Water must have got in between the thin coax link and the R213, but fortunately I did not need to replace the lot as I had a switching point in the greenhouse and only needed to use a  new shorter piece. Now the loss is 0.7 dB and the SWR on 17 metres is 1.3 which I will accept.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my 270 foot rectangular loop works well on LF and after having my FT2000 &quot;widebanded&quot; by Martyn Lynch I had a few QSOs on 60 metres where I had not been for over 10 years at which time it was necessary to hold an NOV licence. It was good to speak on that band to an old friend from Cyprus now returned to the UK as G3SZG (formerly 5B4AHK) and living in Kidderminster.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s hope September and October will bring an Autumn lift on 17 and 15 metres.</p>

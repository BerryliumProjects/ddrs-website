<p>April was another disappointing month with the flux numbers in the low 70&apos;s most of the time. 
I was in Cyprus, (5B4) for two weeks and undoubtedly the propagation in the Mediterranean area was better than in our more northern latitude. I spent two mornings with the members of the Paphos Radio Club when they were out in their new portable shack, given to them by a local farmer, along with free electricity! The farm is organic so they must be very careful not to bring any pollutants on to the land. This means they will have to clear the scrub and weeds by hand and not with the use of chemicals. Their club has two new lady members; one licenced, the other a trainee.</p> 
<p>Back home I had the pleasure of working 5B4AMY, Amanya, for her first QSO.</p>
<p>A new one for me from UK was TA (Turkey) on CW on 40 metres.</p>
<p>Finally, just as the month was ending, on 26th, and around mid-day, (an unusual time) I worked Alaska (KL) on 20 metres SSB. So it&apos;s always worth trying, even under these conditions.</p>
<p>6 Metres should spring to life in May with European sporadic E, and maybe longer distances. </p>

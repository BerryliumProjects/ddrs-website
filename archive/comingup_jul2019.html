<p>Unfortunately, Mary Ashdown is unwell and unable to give her talk on Tuesday 25th June. We wish her well and hope that she is improving. However, our former Chairman, John G3YGG, has very kindly stepped into the breach at short notice and will keep to the theme of Morse Code with a short presentation entitled &quot;CW Still Here&quot;. This will be followed by a surprise entertainment and the usual tea/coffee and biscuits.</p>

<p>Attendees are asked to bring along for display anything Morse related, for example, keys, decoders, pictures and any other articles. Please note that all items should be marked with the owner&apos;s identification in view of possible similarity and duplication.</p>

<p>The club hopes to be active on the air in CW mode towards the end of the evening.</p>

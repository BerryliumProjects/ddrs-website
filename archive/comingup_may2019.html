<p>The Sun not only bathes the Earth in electromagnetic radiation which spans the entire spectrum from radio to x-ray and beyond but also in a stream of charged particles which travel through the solar system at speeds in excess of 1.8 million mph. As these particles reach the Earth, they collide with Earth&apos;s protective magnetic field, becoming captured and trapped in the space around us.</p>

<p>Severe solar storms can damage satellites and disrupt power grids and electrical systems. Sudden ionospheric disturbances (increases in ionisation primarily in the D-region of the ionosphere) can interfere with radio communications and severely limit the operation of the HF band.</p>

<p>Dr Colin Forsyth&apos;s talk will explain how this stream of particles changes and modifies the particles trapped in the magnetic field and results in phenomena such as the aurora and the Van Allen belts. He will also explain what is being done to understand and prevent space weather from impacting on our lives.</p>


<p>Dr Colin Forsyth is a research fellow and lecturer in the Space Plasma Physics Group at UCL&apos;s Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Holmbury St Mary and has been researching various aspects of space weather there for the past 10 years.  His research is focussed on substorms; these are bursts of releases of energy in the Earth&apos;s magnetosphere that lead to bright auroral displays and potential disruption to technology in space and on the ground.</p>

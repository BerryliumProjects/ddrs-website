<p>John Kelly, G3YGG, has recently provided several &quot;Hi-Fun&quot; articles to inspire use of the HF amateur bands, and has demonstrated admirably what a good rig and beam antenna can achieve in the right hands. Indeed the great-circle map of the earth included with his reports gives a good indication of the distances covered.</p>

<p>I am at the opposite end of the scale - an inefficient loop antenna, low power and a novice operator making my first faltering steps with a basic  morse key. Nevertheless, the thrill (panic?) I have experienced making any kind of contact, no matter how little copied, is still a great sense of achievement.</p>

<p> Clearly today&apos;s experts must have been through this phase of development in their younger days. And they must have felt as I do, overwhelmed by the task ahead. I therefore encourage fellow amateurs to continue to try using morse, no matter how rusty or slow, as it helps and encourages us beginners on our way.</p>

<p>This month the QSOs I have enjoyed include a special event station from Ireland celebrating the Wild Atlantic Way - look up EI66WAW on QRZ.com to learn more. There are 9 callsigns (EI11WAW to EI99WAW) to collect - one for each county on the Way - and a certificate if you work all of them. Also a couple of contacts in Germany - not bad considering the effective radiated power was unfocussed and less than a watt. CW at the speed I can work suits QRP well.</p>

<h2>Digital Demonstration Evening - 23 May 2017</h2>

<h3>Walter Blanchard G3JKV and Keith Bell 2E0GBK</h3>

<p> Walter will be covering the basic principles and applications of slow-signalling, low-power transmissions, for example, WSPR. The use of automatic systems offers distinct advantages for evaluating antennas and radio wave propagation at different frequency bands. These techniques supersede the universal &quot;599&quot; reports; instead the actual signal to noise ratio can be measured and reported.</p>

<p>Keith will be demonstrating PSK operation on one or more of 20, 40 and 80m depending upon the conditions and the antenna with help from John G3YGG. Using the software package DM780, participants will be able to make contacts; participation will be encouraged!</p>

<p>Walter has held an amateur radio licence since 1951 as VS1EV in Singapore, and since 1954 as G3JKV in the UK. He has been a member of this Club since 1970 and is a past-chairman. His current interests include low-power digital communication such as WSPR.</p>

Keith was licensed in 2011 via the Club. Before that, his interests included virtual radar, flight simulation, ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) and HFDL (High Frequency Data Links). His current interests include digital modes and he has worked over 150 countries using low power modes. Operation in these modes is now more difficult due to the current HF conditions.</p>

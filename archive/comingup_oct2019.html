<p>Hermes Lite is a low cost DIY HF software defined radio (SDR) transceiver. This is a development of the openHPSDR project which resulted in the Apache Labs Anan series of radios. Hermes Lite utilises the basic design of these radios but reduces the cost significantly by the clever reuse of mass market components, in particular, a broadband modem chip which forms the basis of the HF transceiver.</p>

<p>Spark SDR is a software package which has been developed to complement the Hermes Lite SDR. This software is available for both Windows and Linux operating
systems and offers a number of sophisticated features including the ability to monitor multiple modes over multiple bands simultaneously in addition to conventional radio use.</p>

<p>Alan&apos;s talk will cover the history of the development and production of the Hermes Lite SDR plus a demonstration of the radio and software in operation. There will be an opportunity to experiment with both the radio and the software. More details of the SDR hardware and software can be found on the following web sites:</p>

<p>Alan has an honours degree in engineering and has been interested in radio since his childhood; however, by the time he was old enough to sit for the licence exam, he had become thoroughly hooked on computing with the arrival of the Sinclair ZX80 computer. Subsequently, Alan rekindled his interest in amateur radio a few years ago after becoming interested in constructing a customised 2.4 GHz radio controlled model for performing three-dimensional antenna radiation pattern measurements. His current amateur radio interests are focused upon developing SDR software and exploring low power digital modes.</p>

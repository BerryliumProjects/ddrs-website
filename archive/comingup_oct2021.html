<p>Steve&apos;s talk &quot;<i>999 Emergency -  Public Safety Communication Past, Present....</i>&quot; draws on 35 years of experience in Police mobile communications. It&apos;s a light hearted talk covering emergency communications before electricity, the telegraph, telephone and radio ... and what the future may hold. </p>

<p> Steve was first licensed as G3ZPS at age 16 in 1970 making him one of the youngest to hold an original G3 call sign who is still active. Trained by the MOD as a professional RF design engineer, he moved to the Met Police in 1983 to become their senior Radio Systems Engineer. He was instrumental in the work to upgrade the Met&apos;s ageing communication systems in the 80s and 90s. In recent years he has gone back to one of his earliest loves of restoring vintage HF ham radio gear - building up a large collection of UK and American equipment. Steve is a Fellow of the Institute of Engineering and Technology and in the last 5 years has given a large number of talks on both the history of Emergency Services Communications and Vintage Ham Radio gear. His website <a href="http://www.g3zps.com" target="_blank">www.g3zps.com</a> is regularly updated with new projects. </p>

<p> This will be an in-person meeting at the Friends&apos; Meeting House, Dorking, starting 7:45pm. Visitors welcome. </p>

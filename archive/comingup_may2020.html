<p> Following the cancellation of the March and April meetings due to the coronovirus pandemic lock-down, DDRS is looking forward to using some new communications technology to enable us to meet up. If you are on our mailing list, you should have received an email invitation to attend two virtual meetings tonight over the now-popular &quot;Zoom&quot; internet video application. </p>

<p> The first will be at 8pm and will feature a talk by Chris Deacon on operating over the 6m band. With the sporadic-E season upon us it is a good time to try out the band if you have never used it. There will then be a break for us all to get our own drink and biscuits and return for a second session at 9pm to discuss the topic and ask questions. </p>

<p> You will need to have already installed the Zoom application on your computer, tablet or smartphone. Open the link in the email in advance of the meeting and you will be guided on how to do this. </p>

<p> We look forward to seeing you (literally!). </p>

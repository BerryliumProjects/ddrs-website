<h3>Annual General Meeting with RSGB Film</h3>
<p><i>27 November</i></p>
<p> The club chairman for the last 11 years, John Kelly G3YGG, gave a farewell speech and handed over to the new chairman, Tom Ellinor G4DFA.  The vice-chairmanship was also handed over from Jon Weller G0GNA to Colin Berry M0GXV.</p>

<p> John exhorted the club to encourage new members to join, be trained and get on the air. He also encouraged members to be proactive in committing to the club activities organised for them. </p>

<p> We were also joined by the RSGB deputy regional representative, Alan Cross. </p>

<p> After various discussions covering the accounts and the commission terms for sales activities, we watched a video showing the awesome multi-band, multi-operator K3LR station and the equipment and planning needed to host a significant contest there. </p>

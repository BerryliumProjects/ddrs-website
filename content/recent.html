<h3>Vintage Wireless Museum Visit</h3>

<p><i>25 February 2020</i></p>

<p>After a long journey to Dulwich, we were warmly welcomed to the unsurpassable collection of 20th century entertainment equipment of the British Vintage Wireless and Television museum. Several volunteer guides took us round the collection and explained the significance of anything which aroused our curiosity. It was left by its late founder, Gerry Wells; and as well bringing back memories for interested groups, it is also a supplier of genuine historical equipment to the television and film industry. </p>

<p><i>26 February</i></p>
<p> Tom showed the club how these antenna designs work and how to calculate the various measurements. We then formed 4 teams and set about making one of them for ourselves out of ladder line. The intention was to create a highly portable antenna for 2m which could be hung up and fed at the bottom. </p>

<p> The basic construction was simple enough, but when the finished products were tested using an antenna analyser, the resonant frequencies were not quite as predicted. The beauty of the constructional approach then became evident: it would be fairly simple to adjust the lengths to get a good match at 145MHz. </p>

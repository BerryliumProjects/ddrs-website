 <h3>Antenna Analysers</h3>
<p><i>22 January 2026</i></p>

<p>Colin Berry M0GXV, showed the group what the club's MFJ269 antenna analyser could do, with some practical demonstrations. He also explained how its internal measurement bridge worked and hence its limitations.  Colin then went on the explain how Smith charts can be used to represent complex impedances near a reference point, and why their form enables the effects of transmission lines to be easily represented.</p>

<p>Tom Ellinor G4DFA, then demonstrated the use of a Nano VNA (vector network analyser) to perform similar functions but over a wider frequency range and with an interface to a computer application; and also how it can be used to measure signals passing through filters.</p>

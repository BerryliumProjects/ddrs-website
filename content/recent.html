<h3>Sensors</h3>
<p><i>24 May 2022</i></p>

<p>Mike, G8AVZ, introduced us to the sort of electromagnetic integration design principles that are common to naval ships where, unlike amateur radio, simultaneous operation of multiple sensors is the normal environment.  He showed examples of how location priorities are determined and what sort of compromises have to be made to mitigate mutual interference.  Mike also gave examples of how the very real dangers of EMF are mitigated, which illustrate his amazement that the recent alterations to our licence conditions have emerged so late for amateur radio.</p>

<h3>EMF Calculations</h3>
<p><i>22 February 2022</i></p>

<p>We watched then discussed a recording of a presentation given to Sutton club about the electomagnetic field strength and radiation intensity calculations required to conform with our licences. The spreadsheet which the RSGB had produced to facilitate this was explained in detail, along with the advice which Ofcom has produced to ensure that the general public is not unduly exposed by our activities.  </p>

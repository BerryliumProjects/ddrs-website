<h3>Logger32</h3>

<p><i>26 March</i></p>
<p> Mike Potter gave a detailed demonstration of various logging programs.  Starting with Logger32, he demonstrated how logging programs can do a lot more than just passively record contacts as in a traditional log book. Logger32 is not only free and runs on quite basic computers, but can connect to and control a variety of amateur radio equipment such as selecting and tuning multiple transceivers and operating an antenna rotator. It also connects to DX cluster and ClubLog to provide additional information about potential contacts. Mike explained the key role that the ADIF data format plays in transferring data between logging systems, including ClubLog.</p>

<p>Mike also demonstrated some other logging programs - HamRadioDeluxe, Swisslog, Turbolog and Log4OM.</p>

<h3>J-Pole and Slim Jim Construction</h3>

<p><i>26 February</i></p>
<p> Tom Ellinor showed the club how these antenna designs work and how to calculate the various measurements. We then formed 4 teams and set about making one of them for ourselves out of ladder line. The intention was to create a highly portable antenna for 2m which could be hung up and fed at the bottom. </p>

<p> The basic construction was simple enough, but when the finished products were tested using an antenna analyser, the resonant frequencies were not quite as predicted. The beauty of the constructional approach then became evident: it would be fairly simple to adjust the lengths to get a good match at 145MHz. </p>

<h3>Amateur Radio at Millimetre Wave Frequencies</h3>
<p><i>27 October 2020</i></p>

<p> Chris Whitmarsh gave a comprehensive account of the characteristics of the &quot;millimetre&quot; wave bands. Chris is one of only a few operators equipped to experiment with the very highest frequency amateur bands, which span from 24GHz right up to 241GHz (a wavelength of just 1.2mm). In this strange world, almost reaching up to longer wavelength infra-red light, coaxial transmission lines need to be replaced by short tuned waveguides, and antennas are either horns or dishes. Tiny mixer diodes are used to produce just a few milliwatts of harmonics at the desired frequencies. Signals often travel only a few kilometres and are absorbed by water vapour and oxygen molecules. You need a similarly equipped buddy to QSO with, as the signals are very highly focussed.</p>

<h3>From Top Band to 198kHz</h3>
<p><i>22 September 2020</i></p>

<p> Jim Lee recounted his working life&apos;s journey from a teenager who discovered amateur radio on a short wave receiver, to a continuity presenter on BBC Radio 4. His passion for all things &quot;radio&quot; led him through nervously applying for a job in local radio, through various national radio stations and even international via the BBC World Service. He actively supports G8BBC, an amateur station at the top of Broadcasting House in London. </p>

<h3>Virtual Social Evening</h3>
<p><i>25 August 2020</i></p>

<p> Unable to safely meet around real tables to enjoy food together, we held an online remote fish and chip social via the Zoom application. As well as keeping us all safe, this fun approach enabled members and ex-members from further afield to catch up with news and discuss opportunities presented to the club. Although unlike TV dining shows, there was no prize for the best-looking plate of food!</p>

<h3>Operating on Ranmore</h3>

<p><i>28 July 2020</i></p>

<p> Around 15-20 members and families gathered at Denbies Hillside, Ranmore, on a fine evening to operate portable stations on several HF and VHF bands. After a shaky start &quot;negotiating&quot; with the resident herd of cattle, several antennas and rigs were set up.  Visitors from other clubs also joined us and those without equipment enjoyed catching up with friends and admiring the superbly clear view across to the South Downs and Leith Hill.</p>

<h3>Radio Direction Finding</h3>

<p><i>23 June 2020</i></p>

<p> Members, friends and families met (at a safe distance!) to discover the fun activity of finding beacons hidden among the trees on Headley Heath. We were provided with home-made 3 element directional antennas for the 2m band, and simple AM receivers capable of picking up the beacon signals emitted by the transmitters. To add to the challenge, there were 3 different beacons, each periodically sending their own simplified CW identifier.</p>

<p> Everybody really appreciated seeing each other after such a long break. </p>

<h3>6m Operation</h3>

<p><i>26 May 2020</i></p>

<p>After missing two monthly meetings due to Coronavirus lock-down, the society enlisted the help of some modern technology to have a virtual meeting. Chris Deacon G4IFX used the &quot;Zoom&quot; application to introduce us to operating on the 6 metre band. He described it as the &quot;Magic Band&quot; due to its unpredictable nature, as it benefits from intermittent Sporadic-E propagation. All modes are in use, with digital modes particularly popular.</p>

<h3>Vintage Wireless Museum Visit</h3>

<p><i>25 February 2020</i></p>

<p>After a long journey to Dulwich, we were warmly welcomed to the unsurpassable collection of 20th century entertainment equipment of the British Vintage Wireless and Television museum. Several volunteer guides took us round the collection and explained the significance of anything which aroused our curiosity. It was left by its late founder, Gerry Wells; and as well bringing back memories for interested groups, it is also a supplier of genuine historical equipment to the television and film industry. </p>

<h3>Practical Fault-Finding</h3>

<p><i>28 January 2020</i></p>

<p>Martin Butler related his years of experience, as an engineer, determining the root cause of a fault in electronic equipment. Practical advice was given about how different components fail and how being observant and methodical can give valuable clues. The intelligent use of test equipment and how to stay safe when dealing with high voltages were also explained. </p>

<h3>Radio Direction Finding</h3>

<p><i>23 June 2020</i></p>

<p> Members, friends and families met (at a safe distance!) to discover the fun activity of finding beacons hidden among the trees on Headley Heath. We were provided with home-made 3 element directional antennas for the 2m band, and simple AM receivers capable of picking up the beacon signals emitted by the transmitters. To add to the challenge, there were 3 different beacons, each periodically sending their own simplified CW identifier.</p>

<p> Everybody really appreciated seeing each other after such a long break. </p>

<h3>6m Operation</h3>

<p><i>26 May 2020</i></p>

<p>After missing two monthly meetings due to Coronavirus lock-down, the society enlisted the help of some modern technology to have a virtual meeting. Chris Deacon G4IFX used the &quot;Zoom&quot; application to introduce us to operating on the 6 metre band. He described it as the &quot;Magic Band&quot; due to its unpredictable nature, as it benefits from intermittent Sporadic-E propagation. All modes are in use, with digital modes particularly popular.</p>

<h3>Vintage Wireless Museum Visit</h3>

<p><i>25 February 2020</i></p>

<p>After a long journey to Dulwich, we were warmly welcomed to the unsurpassable collection of 20th century entertainment equipment of the British Vintage Wireless and Television museum. Several volunteer guides took us round the collection and explained the significance of anything which aroused our curiosity. It was left by its late founder, Gerry Wells; and as well bringing back memories for interested groups, it is also a supplier of genuine historical equipment to the television and film industry. </p>

<h3>Practical Fault-Finding</h3>

<p><i>28 January 2020</i></p>

<p>Martin Butler related his years of experience, as an engineer, determining the root cause of a fault in electronic equipment. Practical advice was given about how different components fail and how being observant and methodical can give valuable clues. The intelligent use of test equipment and how to stay safe when dealing with high voltages were also explained. </p>

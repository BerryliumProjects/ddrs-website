 <h3>Ashdown Forest Repeaters</h3>
<p><i>26th March 2024</i></p>

<p>At our first in-person meeting of the year, Paul Phillips G7KBR and Richard Hadfield G4ANN gave a presentation on their work to set up 2 VHF repeaters at St Leonard's church, Turners Hill, West Sussex. The hand-built GB7MH (70cm digital) and GB3MH (2m analogue) repeater equipment is in the church tower, and the antennas are concealed inside the hollow flag pole to give good elevation and coverage area, which extends as far as Dorking. </p>

<h3>Propagation Prediction using the Chilton Ionosonde</h3>
<p><i>23 February 2021</i></p>

<p> Philip Miller Tate gave some background information to the ionosonde at Chilton, OxfordShire, and showed us various examples of the ionograms it produces. He explained the structure and nature of the ionosphere, and how to interpret the ionograms to deduce likely propagation conditions.

<h3>Mr Marconi and his Marvellous Invention</h3>
<p><i>26 January 2021</i></p>

<p> Dr Liz Bruton, a curator at the Science Museum, told the story of how early radio technology progressed from a short range demonstration on Salisbury Plain; to the first live reporting from a ship of a yacht race in Ireland; and to enabling the Titanic to call for help and thus save hundreds of lives. That fateful night was documented minute by minute in the telegraphic communications with other ships, which Liz poignantly described. </p>

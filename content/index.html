<p> Welcome to the Dorking &amp; District Radio Society&apos;s website. </p>

Amateur radio is a popular technical hobby and volunteer public service that uses designated radio frequencies for non-commercial exchange of messages, wireless experimentation, self-training, and emergency communications. You can read more about it in <a href="http://rsgb.org/main/get-started-in-amateur-radio/what-is-amateur-radio/" target="_blank">What is Amateur Radio?</a>.


<p> The Society was founded in 
1947 for the promotion of Amateur Radio in the local area and has been 
operating continuously since. We enjoyed a <a href="articles_70th_anniversary.html">special celebration</a> to mark our seventieth anniversary in 2017. </p>

<p> We meet monthly in Dorking where talks are given either by invited 
speakers or by club members. In addition there are regular opportunities to operate from a permanent station at the Epsom Scout HQ, and at various local portable locations.</p>

<p> Anybody is welcome to come to a meeting and we offer training to those 
wishing to gain the Foundation and Intermediate Licences, with access to a pool of club equipment. </p>

<p> We are a member of the <a href="http://rsgb.org/main" target="_blank">Radio Society of Great Britain</a> (RSGB) and the 
<a href="clubs.html">Southern Counties Amateur Radio Forum</a> (SCARF).</p>

<p> Take a look around our website to get a flavour for the breadth of interests and activities represented in the club. </p>

<p>The annual dinner will be held at the Stepping Stones public house at Westhumble, which is the same location as last year. Members and their partners are invited to come and celebrate and share the personal and club achievements of the year. Ex&#8209;members (associates) who are able to attend are also warmly invited to renew friendships. </p>

<p>If you are on the current mailing list, you should have received an email giving details of the menu, and how to choose and pay for your meal. If you would like to attend but have not received this, please contact the club secretary (<a href="mailto:ddrs.secretary@yahoo.co.uk">ddrs.secretary@yahoo.co.uk</a>).</p>

<p>The menu choices need to be sent to the restaurant in advance, and club also needs your payment in advance so we can settle the food bill on the night. Please make these arrangements before or at the club AGM on 26th November.</p>

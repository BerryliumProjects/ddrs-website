<p> We have a programme of regular Tuesday evening meetings, which are held at the
<a href="http://www.dorking.quaker.eu.org/findus.php" target="_blank">Friends Meeting House</a>,
 Butter Hill (off South Street), Dorking starting at 7:45 pm. Please see our calendar for details. </p>

<p> We have access to the <a href="location_esg.html">7th Epsom Scout Station and Shack</a>, <strong>M0ESG</strong>, on Thursdays from 2pm to 9pm by prior arrangement via the DDRS Chairman. We also operate from this base when supporting the annual Jamboree on the Air (JOTA), welcoming members of local Scout groups to an open radio station they can participate in.</p>

<p> At the September Heritage Weekend each year, we operate from a marquee in the grounds of Polesden Lacey, a local National Trust property. We have operated for several years with the special event callsign <strong>GB0NT</strong>.<p>

<p> We have privileged access to an area on Leith Hill near to the famous tower, from where we can operate. This provides an excellent low-noise location from the highest point in the area. </p>

<p> In the summer, we usually have an expedition to the Devil's Dyke on the South Downs, an elevated rural location with good VHF coverage. <p>

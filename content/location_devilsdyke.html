<p> A good time was had by all who attended this club event on a fine and warm evening.  The rig consisted of the Club&apos;s IC7400 100W transceiver, running from a generator via a mains PSU; the antenna was a short boom, 5 element Yagi at 20ft above ground pointing north-west. Our operating location was from the end of the Devil&apos;s Dyke National Trust car park (IO90VV) which is 700ft above sea level on the South Downs near Brighton.</p>

<p> As usual we were interested in chatting rather than &quot;contesting&quot; and the Dorking Club was complimented on putting on a /P station for that
purpose.  Thanks to all members who helped out at the QTH and on the air.</p>

    <p> As is now traditional, at the end of the evening, we admire the sun setting and panoramic views from this amazing location,
        before deconstructing and enjoying supper at the nearby restaurant. </p>

<p> This year, the annual club outing to the Devil&apos;s Dyke on the South Downs coincided with a heat wave, and this opportunity for an evening of portable operation in a remote elevated location proved a particular success, with many members attending. We also had members of the local Sutton and Cheam club taking part.</p>

<p>There were in total 9 stations, covering a wide variety of HF and VHF bands and modes. We had engaging conversations about what we were doing with several interested visitors, including one person from the U.S. who was intrigued that morse code was still actively in use. </p> 


<p>In the foreground here is John (G3YGG), busy making CW contacts on a straight key using a 6m delta loop. In the background is a small (so-called &quot;magnetic&quot;) loop for 40m, recently reinforced to survive the journey here on a roof rack. Colin (M0GXV) was particularly struck by the low background noise and signal clarity at this remote location, compared to Leatherhead. </p>

<p> Some members attended without portable equipment to enjoy the beautiful scenery and a pleasant social occasion for the club. Others operated on VHF (2m and 70cm) and other HF bands - trying not to interfere with each other.</p>

<p> Once the sun had started to set, we set about deconstructing all the equipment, before forming a large group at the local public house for dinner and a well earned drink. The lovely weather had attracted many other people to the beauty spot, and business was brisk (with a long queue just to order food!). A time of welcome relaxation in the cool of a hot summer&apos;s day. </p>

<h1>Amateur Radio Training</h1>

        <p> Amateur Radio operators are licensed by OFCOM, which authorises transmission within the authorised amateur bands within the overall radio spectrum. As such, it is both an international  communications hobby and a technical and practical skill, all of which can give a sense of achievement and belonging. </p>

        <p> Alongside other local RSGB-affiliated clubs and societies, we offer training  to club members for the Radio Amateur Licence examinations at Foundation and Intermediate Levels, and also organise activities to count towards the practical aspects necessary to qualify for a licence. </p>

        <p> Our trainers have many years of combined experience between them. One is currently a research engineer for the BBC and another has extensive experience in training and examinations, with an unbroken success record. We also have an ex-teacher joining the training team.</p>

        <p>Applicants for the course are asked to join the DDRS at an annual subscription (in 2018)  
of &pound;25 (&pound;15 if a full time student), which gives full access 
to all club meetings and activities, together with the right to borrow 
club equipment. There is no additional fee for a Foundation Course other 
than the cost of the examination which is set by the Radio Society of 
Great Britain (RSGB) which must be paid directly to the Society. There is a 
small charge for the Intermediate Course and again the RSGB fee which 
must be paid directly. </p>

        <p>Course books are available from the RSGB.</p>

<!--	<p>The <b>next training course</b> for the foundation licence starts on 5th October 2017 at 7:30pm until 9:00pm on Thursday evenings, at the <a href="location_esg.html">7th Epsom Scout HQ</a>. This will cover the various practical assessments and prepare for the written examination in late November. </p>
-->
<!--	<p>The next examination date at Dorking will be <b>26th June</b>, before our evening meeting. Although this has been arranged primarily for our existing students, we welcome candidates from other clubs who have been studying for any of the licence levels and are ready for an examination. Please contact the examination secretary George Brind via the usual club email address to register.</p> 
-->        <p>Please see the <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> page for how to progress in this fascinating hobby.</p>

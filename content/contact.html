<p> We hold regular club nets on-air on Sunday mornings from 8:15am on 3.772MHz (LSB).
Members also often get together informally on weekdays around 10am on or near 144.775 MHz (FM).
Our main club callsign is <strong>G7DOR</strong>, and we also have the original  <strong>G3CZU</strong>. If you don&apos;t have a suitable receiver yourself, you could try listening in on a WebSDR (receiver connected to the Internet):

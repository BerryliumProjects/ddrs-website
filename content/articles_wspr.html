<h3> Walter Blanchard, G3JKV </h3>

        <p> The Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR), to give 
          it its proper title, was designed as a way of getting real-time propagation 
          information by using low-power digital signals. A transmitter radiates 
          a short digital signal using a power of a watt or two, then listens 
          to see if any similar signals are coming in. If they are, it decodes 
          them and puts the information on a website. If anyone hears you, they 
          do the same. Then the process repeats itself, all controlled by a PC. 
          The signals you receive are listed by the controlling program and you 
          can see them on your PC at any time. If you want to see if anyone has 
          received you, then you have to go on the Web and find out. It's a sort 
          of automatic DX machine and can be left running, unattended, for many 
          hours at a time. What you do with the information is up to you. At first, 
          it's fascinating to see just how many stations, world-wide, are receiving 
          your pipsqueak transmissions, then more serious applications may occur 
          to you. Some amateurs leave their WSPR stations running for months at 
          a time and log all the results so they can see how propagation varies 
          hour by hour and day by day. Others use them to catch very short duration 
          DX openings that you will never hear by just listening casually. Yet 
          others use them for comparing aerials - verticals vs. horizontals, loops 
          vs dipoles, and so on. It's fun to see just how low a power you can 
          get away with to be heard on 80m in the USA, etc, etc. Over the last 
          few years I've done all of these things; my current project is to leave 
          it running during daylight hours on 10m to see how often that band is 
          open outside Europe even in these low-sunspot days. The answer is - 
          most days, something I would never have suspected just by casually tuning 
          over the band now and again.</p>
        <p> One of the rather nice things about it is that you don't 
          need QRO or huge aerials. In fact, the use of powers over 5w is actively 
          discouraged, because that just jams the other signals in the rather 
          narrow band allocated to WSPR. However, that power is the actual radiated 
          power, so you can put 10w into a short vertical whip that's only 10% 
          efficient and get away with it. It's sometimes a bit difficult to turn 
          down the power so low in the normal 100w rig and anyway most amateurs 
          don't want to commit their main rigs to WSPR for long periods so several 
          specially-designed QRP rigs have appeared on the market. What I use 
          is my Yaesu FT-817, a little portable rig that doesn't see much use 
          except when I go out in the summer. It's maximum CW power is only 4w 
          and it can be turned down to less than 1w quite easily. For powers less 
          than 1w I use a small attenuator that can get me down to 1mW into the 
          aerial. Don't ask me how you measure such small powers - that's an article 
          in its own right! So those with small aerials and low-powered rigs are 
          not at a disadvantage; WSPR is something you can play with no matter 
          how modest your setup.</p>
        <p> So what do you have to do? Well, read up on it first, 
          - G4ILO's pages are a good start - http://www.g4ilo.com/wspr.html. Then 
          you need a PC (or laptop), of course, on which you can install the WSPR 
          program, downloaded either from G4ILO or direct from the WSPR homepage 
          (see http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wspr.html). The bit 
          where you have to do some work is the interface between your PC and 
          your rig. To transmit, your PC puts out an audio tone, around 1500 Hz, 
          generated by the WSPR program which has to be sent to the rig as a modulating 
          tone; the rig operates in USB SSB mode. A very crude way of doing this 
          is to use the audio to drive a small loudspeaker which is placed near 
          the mike on the rig, but a much better method is to input it to the 
          rig via its external audio drive auxiliary pin (usually found on a DIN 
          socket at the back). That way you can accurately control the audio level 
          and hence power output. The rig, of course, also has to be switched 
          to "transmit" at the same time but the WSPR program controls Tx/Rx switching 
          via one of the COM ports on the PC. For the reverse process, delivering 
          received signals to the PC, receiver audio is taken to the PC audio 
          board. There is usually a pin on the auxiliary DIN giving a fixed-level 
          audio signal so you don't have to twiddle the audio gain control. The 
          WSPR program takes care of all the rest. Details of how to connect up 
          the various interface systems are given on G4ILO's site. I recommend 
          using an interface that completely isolates the PC from the rig, by 
          using transformers or opto-isolators, to prevent hum and other spurious 
          modes appearing. It's quite easy to make your own, but commercial versions 
          are advertised in "Radcom". </p>
        <p>There are two other matters requiring attention, the first 
          being the frequency stability of your rig. WSPR is a narrow-band system 
          and requires that your rig can hold a frequency within about 2 Hz for 
          2 minutes. Modern rigs can do this fairly easily even at 10m if they're 
          allowed to warm up for an hour or so, but if you decide to go for 6m 
          or higher it's worth checking. Most VHF/UHF rigs cannot do it at 2m 
          and above and require specialised frequency control, which is why you 
          will not hear much about WSPR at VHF. The second is accurate timing. 
          WSPR transmits for two minutes at a time and the start of each transmission 
          must be exactly at an even minute of time, within 2 seconds. This is 
          absolute time, locked to GMT, and no PC I know of can maintain time 
          this accurately for more than a day or so. You can get over this by 
          using the PC's "Internet Time" feature (right-click on the bottom-right 
          time block). Alternatively, there are several "Internet Time" programs 
          (free!) to be found on the Web - I use one called "Dimension 4" that 
          gives more facilities than the PC built-in one.</p>
        <p> Having done all this what can you get? If you consider 
          a WSPR "contact" as a QSO (ARRL don't!) then you can do a "WAC" in about 
          ten minutes on 30m, and DXCC in a couple of days. Or leave it running 
          all night on 80m and see how many W's you've "worked" by morning. You 
          can leave it running on different bands each day and see exactly when 
          each band opens and closes to different areas. I've found it quite interesting 
          to run 10w to an 8ft mobile whip on 160m and see how far it gets round 
          the UK. I was a bit shattered to find one night that it was being heard 
          in DL, SM and OK - the radiated power could not have been more than 
          100 mW.</p>
        <p> Doing aerial comparisons it's a bit boring to have to 
          sit there manually changing over aerials every few minutes so I built 
          a little automatic aerial changeover switch that switches between two 
          aerials on alternate transmissions. That way I could couple up two aerials, 
          each with its own ATU, and see how they differed in the DX they captured. 
          In particular, I spent some months earlier this year comparing a vertical 
          quarter-wave against a horizontal half-wave on 80m and found the horizontal 
          won every time, at all distances. In fact, much of the real DX (US West 
          Coast, JA, etc) was only workable on the dipole. So much for the much-vaunted 
          "low-angle" radiation of verticals! There are endless experiments of 
          this type you can do - is that new aerial really any better than your 
          old one? Does it work better in a slightly different location? Would 
          a longer "long wire" make any difference? And so on. </p>
        <p>Have a go - and have fun. </p>

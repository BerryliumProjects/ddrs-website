     <p> In August we don't have a Tuesday evening meeting, to avoid the traditional holiday season. However we meet at a member's home for an informal summer social. In 2019 this was held at Tom and Sue Ellinor's home in Banstead. Around 20 members and partners attended, enjoying fish and chips and a choice of desserts. It was a warm evening and the photo was actually taken in darkness with a garden floodlight illuminated the flowers in the background. </p>

    <p> In December we enjoy a Christmas dinner at a local restaurant, again with partners. An opportunity to celebrate and share the personal and club achievements of the year. Ex&#8209;members (associates) who are able to attend are also warmly invited to renew friendships. </p>

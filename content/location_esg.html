<p> Each October, the station usually takes part in the annual <a href="http://jotajoti.info" target="_blank">Jamboree on the Air</a>, which the club supports by providing experienced qualified operators, who are available to answer questions and enable members of all the Scout sections to participate.  Scouts can also join in over the internet. In 2018, we introduced members of two Epsom scout groups to JOTA, amateur radio and morse code, which helped with their badge work. </p>

<p> In February there is a similar event for the Girl Guides: <a href="https://www.wagggs.org/en/what-we-do/world-thinking-day/" target="_blank">World Thinking Day on the Air</a>.</p>

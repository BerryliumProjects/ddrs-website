<p> Following the formal part of the meeting, Bob Burns has kindly agreed to give a talk. Here is the synopsis he has provided:</p>

<p> This illustrated talk looks at the various types of HF aerial that
may be implemented including compact varieties that may be
constructed in typical small suburban gardens.<br>
It commences by looking at the numerous decisions that must
be made in selecting a suitable aerial and then moves on to
examine a number of types of aerial that may be made in a full
size or more compact form. These includes ‘long’ wires and
‘large’ loops, dipoles, multiband dipoles, trapped dipoles,
ground planes, trapped verticals, folded monopoles and a
clothes line aerial. The talk finishes by examining feeders and a
homebrew dual Z-Match covering 1.8 – 146MHz.<br>
On display will be the clothes line aerial, some homebrew open
wire feeders and the dual Z-Match.</p>

<p>This annual expedition to the Devil's Dyke on the South Downs is taking place a month later than in previous years. As sunset will be around 8pm, we will be meeting from 4pm onwards, and eating at the nearby restaurant from 8pm. Park at the far end of the National Trust car park; we will operate from the grassy area next to the overflow car park, which this year has been cordoned off. All are encouraged to participate at one of the portable stations which will be set up.</p> 

<p>If you are unable to come, you are of course welcome to call the club station from home or your own choice of portable location.</p>

<p> The postcode is BN1 8YJ (Maidenhead Locator IO90VV).  You can get directions to this beautiful location from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/devils-dyke">National Trust</a>.</p>

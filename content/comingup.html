<p>At this time of the year it would be nice if we could all sit around a table and have a great evening chatting and eating dinner, sadly this year that&apos;s not possible.</p>

<p> So the next best thing is for us to join together online. Can we encourage you to join us on Tuesday 22nd December from 7:45pm. Please arrange your own drinks and food or nibbles etc. Silly party hats and crackers are optional.</p>
<p> Members should have received an email with the appropriate link to join the meeting - if yours hasn&apos;t arrived, please check your junk/spam folder or contact the club <a href="mailto:ddrs.events@gmail.com">events mailbox</a> to verify your email address with us.</p>

<p>If you can&apos;t make the meeting, can we take the opportunity to wish you all a happy Christmas, a healthy 2021 and of course lots of exciting DX !</p>

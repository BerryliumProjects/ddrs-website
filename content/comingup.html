<p> Our next meeting is a planned outdoor operating event (subject to weather conditions). <p>

<p> This is a National Trust location with a car park and spectacular views - see <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/National+Trust's+Denbies+Hillside/@51.2427291,-0.3823883,13.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4875dd87e3c0ba35:0xaa605bf0b1597e87!8m2!3d51.2412429!4d-0.3660914">map</a> for address and directions. The grid square locator is <b>IO91TF</b>.</p>

<p>Access to the main field (with the best views) is through a gate next to the ticket machine and display board. It is light until around 20:15 so we suggest you come from 18:30 onwards to set up equipment.</p>

<p>Please remember that this is a public site so give consideration to others using the location for recreation. Ideally, please bring headphones to avoid turning the speaker volume up too much.</p>

<p>Some club equipment will be brought to site for people to use. It is intended to operate as many bands a possible, but also to share the operating particularly to give some who have limited access to some bands at home a chance to try other bands and modes.</p>

<p><i>Club members are welcome to bring their own kit particularly if you are operating a mode such as digital or one of the lesser used bands and are willing to share / demonstrate the kit to other club members. If possible you should try to arrive with the idea of coordinating bands so as many as possible get a chance to try a band.</i></p>

<p><u>Please note there are no toilet facilities or mains power at the site</u>, though it may be possible to bring a generator to site which will support medium power equipment.</p>

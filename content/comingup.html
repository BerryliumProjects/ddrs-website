<p>The 40m band sits comfortably between the 80m band which is swamped by the
local man-made noise and the enthusiastic DX focus of the 20m band. However,
it normally needs a large outdoor space for an antenna and routing for feeders
back to the station. A small loop antenna can avoid these constraints and even
work indoors, albeit with some reduction in efficiency and more critical tuning. </p>

<p>In April 2017 Colin presented a talk to the DDRS in which he described his
journey of discovery over several years to understand what is really going on in
such an antenna and how to evolve a working experiment without expensive
components. He closed his talk by saying that future investigation would try to
answer the question of why the antenna appeared so much more inefficient in
practice than the theory predicted.</p>

<p>In this evening&apos;s presentation, Colin will aim to answer this question by investigating the effects upon a small loop antenna of an imperfect ground
outside and building features inside. In addition to losing energy via heating the ground, a low antenna also has an unusual directionality towards the sky,
leading to &quot;near vertical incidence skywave&quot; propagation which results in some unusual features.</p>

<p>Colin became interested in radio and electronics at a young age, and discovered amateur radio by picking up a topband morse practice station on a shortwave set. He passed the RAE at university, but difficulties learning to read CW were a barrier to gaining an HF licence and the hobby lapsed. That was until his son discovered amateur radio for himself and they both became licensed. Colin is still practising CW to follow QSOs on 40m, and the loop antenna has been ideal for this and for satisfying his appetite for experimentation.</p>

<p>The club had intended to have a fish and chip supper at Tom and Susan Ellinor&apos;s home; however this has had to be cancelled due to an adverse weather forecast and insufficient easing of Coronavirus restrictions for group meetings in private gardens. </p>

<p> Instead, there will be a social meeting via the Zoom application from 7.30pm. Members should have received an email with the appropriate link to join the meeting - if yours hasn&apos;t arrived, please check your junk/spam folder or contact the club <a href="mailto:ddrs.events@gmail.com">events mailbox</a> to verify your email address with us.</p>

<p> You are at liberty to enjoy your own meal during the meeting. Be aware that Zoom meetings are limited to 40 minutes - if/when we get disconnected, please reconnect to continue.</p>

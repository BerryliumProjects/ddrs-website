<p> The club usually operates portable stations from the Devil&apos;s Dyke car park on the South Downs in July.  This year, due to the current uncertainty regarding the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions, with access to the local restaurant in particular, a similar activity closer to the local area is being considered instead.</p>

<p> Further details will be provided when available and with consideration to government advice nearer the time. </p>

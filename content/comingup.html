<p> This will be a practical evening covering the construction of a portable J-Pole or Slim Jim antenna.  <b>Please bring some tools suitable for the evening&apos;s activity, for example, some pliers, wire cutters and, if possible, a soldering iron.</b></p> 


<p>Much has already been published on these types of vertically polarised antenna, both in radio magazines and on the internet,Â and many claims have been made for the gain figures achievable compared to that of a dipole, as they provide a lower take-off angle than that achievable with a ground plane antenna. However, one thing which is certain is that the basic J design lends itself to being used in various forms ranging from a rigid structure to a roll-up which can go in a suitcase and be taken on holiday.</p> 

<p>With spring approaching it would seem to be a good time to think about an antenna that can go portable. The evening is intended for people to have a go at making a 2m J-Pole or Slim Jim antenna that can be rolled up and taken anywhere.</p>

<p>Tom was first licensed in December 1972 as G8GYX when the Class B Licence was 2m and above only and most were still using crystal based AM rigs. He subsequently took the Morse Test and became G4DFA in May 1974. Upon leaving school, he worked for a small subcontractor assembling naval and marine distress equipment to Admiralty wiring standards. After a few years he applied to the BBC&apos;s Equipment Department as a junior technician. He was successful and his first role was testing all sorts of studio and transmitter station equipment; at this time most of the kit used by the BBC was still designed and built in-house.</p>

<p>Having spent some time on 80 and 160m, his interested waned and for some years he was mostly inactive. When he came back to the hobby all had changed; 2m FM was popular and a wide range of Japanese kit had arrived. His interest grew in VHF / UHF again and this is still a big part of his activity today. Tom also enjoys constructing and repairing older kit.</p>

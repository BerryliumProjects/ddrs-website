<h2>Tuesday 22nd July - Operating Evening and Social</h2>

<!-- <h3></h3> -->

<table>

    <tr><td>
<p> The club will meet from late afternoon (time TBA) at the National Trust car park at Devil's Dyke, to operate portable stations in the adjoining areas. Some club equipment will be available for people without their own portable kit to gain experience and join in.</p>

<p> Afterwards we will meet for a social dinner at The Royak Oak at Poynings. </p>

<p> If you don't want to travel to this event, then you can join in from home. Listen out for the club callsigns being used (G7DOR and G3CZU, likely with an 'X' regional club locator).  This is a good opportunity to invite guests to see amateur radio in action, and to try out a new mode. The club callsigns will be available for use under supervision.</p>

<p> If the weather turns out to be too wet to operate safely, another email will be issued to members.</p>

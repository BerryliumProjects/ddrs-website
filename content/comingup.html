<p>The use of Morse code for CW operation goes back to the very earliest days of amateur radio, and was once a necessary skill to get a full licence. Although that is no longer the case, it is still a satisfying accomplishment, enthusiastically embraced by many operators of low power and portable equipment and by a growing worldwide community of contesters. </p>

<p> This evening will be an informal introduction to various aspects of operating using this mode, with the intention of being hands-on and interactive. No prior experience needed! Colin, Mike and Tim are members of the club, and although not experts, they do enjoy using it and hope to inspire others to have a go.  They will be sharing their experiences as operators who are very much still learning.</p>

<p> This will be the first club meeting NOT on Zoom for a long time. We will be meeting at the Friends Meeting House, Butter Hill, Dorking, at 7:45pm. There is limited parking on site, with plenty more behind Sainsbury&apos;s nearby.</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.icqpodcast.com" target="_blank">ICQ Amateur / Ham Radio Podcast</a> is a free, non-commercial, fortnightly radio talk-style podcast for amateur and ham radio operators by amateur and ham radio operators. Each episode typically consists of a review of current news and a discussion of a selected technical feature together with various aspects of the hobby in general. Contributions from the podcasts&apos; many listeners from around the world are also included. The podcasts can be used to promote club events, amateur radio projects and various amateur and ham radio news stories. Where appropriate, an audio interview can be conducted for a particular feature or event. Independent reviews of ham radio equipment, accessories, books etc are also provided; these are presented strictly without any bias or financial inducement.</p>

<p>Martin started his working career at Philips making colour televisions and spent ten years as a Radio and Television Engineer. During this time he passed his City and Guilds exams and had his first experiences with Amateur Radio; however, at this stage he remained a Short Wave Listener.</p>

<p>Following twenty years in the computer industry, in 1999, whilst working with another contractor who was an Amateur Radio enthusiast, Martin decided to become involved in the hobby himself and went to Brighton College to study for his RAE. He passed the exam in December 2000 and received the call sign M1MRB. Martin has been an active member of the Sutton and Cheam Radio Society since 1999 and is now a committee member. In 2005, a group from the club decided to start a training group and he has now become the lead instructor. Martin is a member of the Radio Society of Great Britain and the GQRP Club1. His latest venture is working with Colin M6BOY on the ICQ Amateur / Ham Radio Podcast which he is enjoying very much.</p>

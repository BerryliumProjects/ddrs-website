		    <p>This September, rather than running a station at Polesden Lacey, we had hoped to be taking part in this annual event, operating between 10am and 4pm from the station at the Scout hut at Epsom Methodist Church. </p>

		    <p> Unfortunately the national event has been cancelled by its organisers, out of respect for the period of mourning for the Queen&apos;s death. </p>

<p> It is with regret that we must postpone Club meetings - March, April and maybe further on in the year, in light of government announcements concerning the spread of the COVID-19 virus. </p>

<p> Don&apos;t forget that you can keep in touch with DDRS either through this website or on the air:

<ul>
  <li>  80m - Sundays at 8:30am, 3772 KHz </li>
  <li>  2m - around 10:00am daily, 144.775 MHz </li>
</ul>

</p>

<p> The <a href="https://rsgb.org/main/" target="_blank">Radio Society of Great Britain</a> is currently carrying a news article regarding the impact of Coronavirus precautions on other events in the wider amateur radio world. No doubt this will be maintained with ongoing news. </p>

<p> Other <a href="http://ddrs.org.uk/clubs.html">local amateur radio clubs</a> may also be holding regular Nets on the air, which may help keep you informed about what is going on in the area. </p>

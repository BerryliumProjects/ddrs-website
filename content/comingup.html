<p>The club intends to have a fish and chip supper at Tom and Susan Ellinor&apos;s home, to which all members and families are invited. However it will be logistically different from previous years in order to allow members to be &quot;socially-distant&quot; in the garden. More details will be provided when available, including arrangements for pre-ordering food which will be bought on the day. </p>

<p>It should be noted that, because this must be held outdoors, if the weather report appears to be inclement, the event could be be cancelled at relatively short notice. We will update this web page and send an email if this is the case. </p>

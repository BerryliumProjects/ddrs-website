<h2>Tuesday 27th May - Operating Evening</h2>

    <tr><td>
<p> The club will meet from 7:15pm in the main National Trust car park on Headley Heath, to operate portable stations in the adjoining field. Some club equipment will be available for people without their own portable kit to gain experience and join in.</p>

<p> This is a good opportunity to invite guests to see amateur radio in action, and to try out a new mode. The club callsigns will be available for use under supervision.</p>

<p> If the weather turns out to be too wet to operate safely, another email will be issued to members.</p>

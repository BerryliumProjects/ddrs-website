<p> We are delighted to have an event arranged for our normal club night, 23rd June. We plan to start this event earlier in the evening so we have sufficient hours of daylight. However if you canâ€™t make it for 7pm, then come when you can, you should still be able to join in some of the activity. </p>

<p>This will be a practical outdoor event with the objective being to radio direction-find hidden 2m transmitter &quot;bugs&quot; which will be positioned around Headley Heath. We plan to have some bugs located close to the car park, a second group of bugs located on flat ground in the woodland area and a third group located further away on more undulating terrain. So there will be something for everyone whatever your preferences, mobility or agility. You can do as much or as little as you wish. </p>

<p>Radio Direction Finding equipment will be provided so you don&apos;t need to bring anything. If you have a favourite scanner or portable 2m receiver capable of receiving AM and a suitable hand-portable directional antenna you might like to bring that along, but it&apos;s not required.</p>

<p><b> Given the current COVID 19 situation and government instructions and guidelines we should form into small groups of no more than 6 people and we must of course observe the usual social distancing requirements at all times.</b></p>

<p>To ensure we can manage this event successfully please advise your intentions to <a href="mailto:ddrs.events@gmail.com">ddrs.events@gmail.com</a> no later than Monday 15th June. If attending, please include your mobile phone number so we can contact you in the event of a last minute bad weather cancellation. In the event of bad weather we intend to reschedule the event, provisionally to a week later, 30th June.</p>

<p>There are two nearby National Trust car parks at Headley Heath. NT members can park for free, otherwise &pound;1.50 per hour, or 3 hours for &pound;4. We plan to use the smaller South car park (about 500m beyond the main car park if travelling from the Headley Village shop to the Betchworth road direction).</p>

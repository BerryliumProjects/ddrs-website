<p>Our next meeting is a visit to the extensive <a href= "https://www.amberleymuseum.co.uk/" target="_blank">Amberley Museum</a>. It is not open on Tuesdays, so we have decided to go on a Saturday to enable a whole day out. <p>

<p>The museum has limited parking and gets busy at the weekends, so they require advanced booking. Further details will be provided via email to confirm if you wish to attend.</p>

<p>Please note that there is no meeting on Tuesday evening 24/10, as the hall is not available.</p>

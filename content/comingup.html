<p> We will meet on Headley Common to play &quot;find the beacons&quot; as we did last summer. Meet at 7:15pm ready to start promptly at 7:30, to ensure that we get a reasonable time before dusk.  Details of where to meet will be communicated via email.</p>

<p> Note: this is a social fun evening, NOT a club operating event - please don&apos;t bring your rig! </p>

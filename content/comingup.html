<p>A month later than originally planned due to Covid, we welcome back Steve for our first in-person meeting of the year. Steve will cover a potted history of war surplus and classic ham radio kit and why it&apos;s still fun to restore and use it.  He has restored over 40 HF stations in recent years and takes great delight in working stations around the world on gear that could be over 50 years old. </p>

<p>Steve is a professional engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) and has held his G3ZPS callsign for 52 years since he was 16 years old.</p>

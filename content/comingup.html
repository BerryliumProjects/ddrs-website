<p>This month there will be <b>no meeting at Dorking</b>. Instead, we are forming a party to visit the <a href="http://www.bvwtm.org.uk/" _target="_blank">Vintage Wireless and Television Museum</a> at West Dulwich. Formally the private passion of curator Gerry Wells, it is now housed in its own purpose built facility behind the house he used to occupy. Local parking is likely to be a challenge as it is in a residential area, so anyone who wishes to come and has not yet registered an interest should arrange to travel with others or by public transport.</p>

<p>There is an admission charge to the museum of &pound;10, and we will have the benefit of a guide during the evening. Please pay the club&apos;s account directly if possible, otherwise bring cash - the club will then pay a single cheque to cover the whole group.</p>

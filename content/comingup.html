<p> Mike&apos;s talk will consist of a live demonstration of Logger32. This is a very popular Amateur Radio logging program which has been developed to provide a highly user configurable, general purpose logbook with computer control support for many radios and antenna rotators. Logger32 is not designed specifically as a contesting logging program, although it could not be used for this purpose. Logger32 is available free of charge and, unlike many other popular software packages, is still being actively supported and developed. Mike will also make reference to earlier logging programs which he has used.</p> 

<p> Mike&apos;s employment background was in the chemical industry and in computer manufacturing but he has now been retired for 20 years. His interest in Amateur Radio began over 60 years ago, originally a short wave listener as a boy in the mid-1950s. Initially he used an old broadcast receiver but progressed to various &quot;classic&quot; receivers including Hallicrafters, BC348, R1155 and AR88 plus quite a few others.</p>

<p> Work, girlfriends, marriage and family commitments intervened until around 1980 when he rekindled his interest in Amateur Radio. His first call sign in 1980 was G8ZQO. In 1982 Mike passed the Morse Test and obtained his present call sign G4PFF. Since then he has been mainly active on HF phone modes but, in the 1980s, he dabbled with Creed teleprinters and RTTY (with the smell of oil and the noise not enjoyed by his family).</p>

<p> In 1999, Mike retired and went to live in Cyprus where he was most active as 5B4AGX and ZC4CMP. Currently with the sunspots in the doldrums and using less ambitious antennas he spends more time looking for new countries to work with little success. Mike also dabbles in IOTA and is a member of CDXC.</p>

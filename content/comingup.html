<p> <b><i> Playing Tunes with Multiple Antennas </i></b> </p>

<p>Over the past decade, starting from some physicists using their amateur radio skills to conduct tests in Venice, the use of orbital angular momentum has gained increased interest to radio engineers as a technology to send increased quantities of data over a limited frequency bandwidth. The concept that is most practically implemented using multiple antennas in effect causes them to play different &quot;tunes&quot; over the airwaves and create multiple channels within the same frequency that do not interfere with each other. More recently, the presenters have been working on evolving orbital angular momentum into linear angular momentum and they will explain how the tunes are used there to enable high speed communication for vehicles, trains and even hyperloops. These concepts have been tested using amateur radio equipment that will also be shown.

<h2>Tuesday 21st January - History and CW in Essex </h2>

<h3>Colin Berry, M0GXV</h3>

<table>

    <tr><td>
<p> Colin will talk about a visit to the Secret Nuclear Bunker at Kelvedon Hatch in Essex - also the site of the GB0SNB web SDR. The following day was a Boot Camp to improve Morse code skills, organised by the Essex CW Amateur Radio Club, and Colin will explain and demonstrate how that worked. </p>

<p> This is an in-person meeting at Dorking, which is a change to the planned arrangements. The Quaker meeting house is unavailable in February, so will be an ideal opportunity for Karl Read to give his remote presentation.</p>

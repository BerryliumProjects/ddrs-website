<p>... or how one of the greatest bands in the story of jazz was discovered because of ionospheric propagation. </p>

<p>Bill &quot;Count&quot; Basie&apos;s small band playing in a sleazy club in Kansas City was broadcast live across the city in 1936. But who else heard him? How and why was that important for the band&apos;s future? This presentation looks at the Count himself and his background, the music of the time, some of the key jazz musicians of the Swing era and the pivotal role of the man who discovered and promoted them. There&apos;s a look at the development of broadcasting and some aspects of ground wave and ionospheric propagation. It also touches on the social, political and economic background to the time which both enabled the music to flourish and to be exploited.  There are some gangsters and Lordly connections too! </p>

<p>Colin Richards has held an amateur radio licence for about 50 years. That&apos;s just about as long as he has been interested in jazz music, having been introduced to the likes of Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Bix Beiderbecke and later the bands of Count Basie, Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington, by his elder brother. The two worlds of jazz and radio rarely cross however. </p>

<p>His career was as a civil servant, mostly working mostly in the (then) Department of Trade and Industry. For many years there he was Head of Enforcement and Interference Policy in the Radiocommunications Agency, now part of the telecoms regulator Ofcom. Later he was a member, and secretary, of the RSGB&apos;s EMC Committee.</p>

<p>Colin played trumpet at school and dabbled a bit in clarinet later, but the demands of a family and a career cut short any major developments in his playing. After early retirement he decided to take up the saxophone seriously. Presently he plays tenor saxophone in the Surrey Hills Big Band and lead alto saxophone in the Redstone Community Big Band.</p>

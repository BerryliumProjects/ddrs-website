<p>The aim of this annual expedition to the Devil&apos;s Dyke on the South Downs is to establish and run a 2m SSB/FM station, commencing at 5:30pm and operating until about 8:30pm using G7DOR/P. All are encouraged to participate or to operate other stations on other frequencies. </p> 

<p>Please come to Devil&apos;s Dyke to participate in whatever way you wish. There is a <a href="https://www.vintageinn.co.uk/restaurants/south-east/thedevilsdykebrighton" target="_blank">pub with good food</a>, where we usually have dinner after the station has been taken down. If you are unable to come, you are of course welcome to call the club station.</p>

<p> The postcode is BN1 8YJ.  You can get directions to this beautiful location from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/devils-dyke">National Trust</a>. We usually set up at the North-East end of the car park behind the restaurant.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="location_devilsdyke.html">a previous year&apos;s expedition</a> to get a flavour of this popular evening.</p>

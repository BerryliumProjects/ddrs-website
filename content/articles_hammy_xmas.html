<i>We wish you a Hammy Christmas,<br>
We wish you a Hammy Christmas,<br>
We wish you a Hammy Christmas,<br>
DX in your ear!</i><br>
<br>
Bad tidings we fear,<br>
For you and your mates,<br>
Conditions are lousy,<br>
No sun-spots - it&apos;s fate.<br>
<br>        
Next year will bring worse,<br>
And noise is a curse,<br>
Auroras will strangle<br>
Your sigs at their birth.<br>
<br>
But don&apos;t give up calling<br>
CQ - Are you there?<br>
Please contact me quickly,<br>
XYL&apos;s in my hair!<br>
<br>
<i> We wish you a Hammy Christmas,<br> 
We wish you a Hammy Christmas,<br>
We wish you a Hammy Christmas,<br>
Good Skeds in New Year.</i><br>
<br>
Antennas stay high,<br>
QRM never nigh,<br>
But if it is present<br>
Then use BHI.<br>
<br>
Conditions we hope<br>
Will rise up like smoke,<br>
And DX and contacts,<br>
Like when they choose Pope!<br>
<br>        
This low cycle song<br>
Is really too long,<br>
We fear they are foolish,<br>
These words from our tongue.<br>
<br>
<i>We wish you a Happy Christmas,<br>
We wish you a Happy Christmas,<br>
We wish you a Happy Christmas<br>
And a Happy New Year!<br>

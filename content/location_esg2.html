<p> Each October, the station usually takes part in the annual <a href="http://jotajoti.info">Jamboree on the Air</a>, which the club supports by providing experienced qualified operators, who are available to answer questions and enable members of all the Scout sections to participate. Unfortunately this particular station&apos;s involvement has had to be cancelled for 2017, however Scouts can still join in over the internet. </p>
